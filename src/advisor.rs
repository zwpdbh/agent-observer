//! The model-driven stages of the pro agent. Port of `python-pro/advisor.py`.
//! Two calls start at the beginning of every night:
//!
//! 1. night_plan   (natural-language understanding + plan adaptation): reads tonight's forecast and the current
//!    bulletin and decides whether tonight is a bad night for faint must-observe targets and which compass
//!    sectors to keep away from. The planner uses both answers for the whole night.
//! 2. fault_review (data parsing + action decision): reads the agent's own hour-by-hour quality table of the last
//!    nights and judges how likely an unannounced instrument fault is. The answer sets how readily the agent
//!    reports (probes) a fault tonight.
//!
//! A third, occasional call confirms a paid fault report before it is sent.
//!
//! Calls run in the background (llm_client::Call); the agent waits for them only as long as the wall clock allows
//! and keeps planning otherwise. Every answer is validated; a missing or invalid answer leaves the rule-based
//! value in place for that night.
